## Application form for Hola Code ##
  Remake admission forms and add new functionalities to Hola <code/> application form, which is currently only a google form. Being able to save the application progress. Give staff statistics of results and grading the tests.


## General Information ##
Making the a database to store applicants personal information, test progress and results. Giving the Hola Code team tools to grade and evaluate faster the entrance test and get statistics to help them plan strategies for getting more people to apply.
We are familiar with SQL and MongoDB and we try to implement for work together.
  
## Summary ##
 This app currently allows the applicant to create an account, by registering and later on having access into their profile, where they'll fill their information, which will be saved. It as well shows 2 of the 3 test forms, of the test, it is storing the data, but it is yet pending to be evaluated automatically.


## Problem ##
  With the original form, applicants can not save their progress and if they input the wrong contact information staff can't communicate with them. Tests are being graded manually, taking time and accuracy problems, later on staff should contact applicants.

## Solution ##
  This app allows applicants to solve the assessments in different sessions, instead of all at once. They can continue after they save their progress by submitting one of the completed assessments. They can also correct or change their personal information by editing in the profile.
  In addition to this on the staff's side, it will help to grade the tests and get statistics based on the information collected from registered applicants (staff side yet to be developed).

## Legacy ##
  Have 3 assessments complete to be answered by applicants and later on have the app grade them automatically. Grade's are only seen by staff, therefore there should be a staff dashboard.
  Once this is completed, analytical tools will be added to the staff dashboard.
